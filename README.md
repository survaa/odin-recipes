# odin-recipes
TheOdinProject Recipes web development project. This project combines the basic HTML and Git skills I have learned in a cohesive project. The main goal is to demonstrate what skills I have learned by going through all of the steps of setting up a GitHub repo, cloning that into Git on my local machine, and writing HTML code to create a basic website.
